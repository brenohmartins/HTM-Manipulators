# HTM-Manipulators
homogeneous transformation matrix in robotic manipulators

This project is a study on homogeneous transformation matrix operations using the Denavit-Hartenberg notation in order to return the transformed matrix, starting from the base of the manipulator to the final effector, in relation to the number of links that the manipulator has.
